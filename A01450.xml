            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But whether the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both ſhoulde bee faſted, it remaineth doubtfull. The <hi>Mediolanenſes,</hi> and the Eaſt Churches, peremptorilie concluded, that they were not to faſt then, becauſe Chriſt was then free of his trouble, and reſted qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly the Sabboth day in his Sepulchre. But the Roman Church, and the church of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and other Churches, affirmed it to be meete, that the time wherein Chriſt was

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is ledde by another reaſon then that which hath beene premiſed, why the VVedneſday ſhoulde bee giuen to faſting, namely, becauſe Chriſt vppon a VVedneſday aſcended vp into heauen, Which reaſon of his, if wee ſhoulde gaine ſay, and ſtande vppon it, that hee aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the Thurſday, which is more probable wee coulde not bee conuicted. This his reaſon grounded vppon Chriſts aſcention is verie much applauded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt himſelfe did then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt vs for to faſt, when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome ſhoulde bee taken from vs.<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> But the ſequell of this Chapter, will verie well ſhewe, the weakeneſſe and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this allegation.

If we take a ſhort ſuruey either of the priuate faſtings of the godly, or of the publique faſtings of the holy Saintes of GOD, we ſhall finde them alwayes vſed in great and weightie matters, and in

That thine almes may be currant, it is not materiall, whether the perſon be honeſt, or lewd, vpon whom thou beſtoweſt it, or howe much or little it is that thou beſtoweſt.

It may bee that hee to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou giueſt thy almes, be both honeſt and diſtreſſed: and yet thy almes may bee no true almes, becauſe thy heart is not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with that mercy which is required.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, ſo it is that much is giuen by him that hath much, and but little of him that hath but little: and yet that much is altogether a faigned, and this little the moſt perfect Almes.

He hath ſent pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for the good of the poore, and riches, for the good of the rich. Want to the poore is oftentimes as good, as hunger to the ſick.

Almes is a worke and dutie of charitie, but the rule of charitie is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto all, and there is none that hath a priuiledge that he ſhould not be charitable. Yet this muſt be conſidered, that as al almes are not of the ſame nature, but are diſtinct, and of two kinds, publike, and priuate: ſo al men confuſedly, are not to giue them, but according to their callings, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe either publike or priuate.<note place="margin">Publike Almes.

But nowe in this Realme, the charge in ſome ſort is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, and committed to others, as Churchwardens and Collectors for the poore, beeing lay perſons. And this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is good and conuenient inough, if ſo be they be faithfull, and defraud not the poore, by appropriating to themſelues, that which was giuen vnto a publike vſe. For the prouident regarde of prouiſion for the poore, principally doth belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the charge of the Miniſters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, who by exhortations and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are diligently to further it: and to the ciuill Magiſtrate more eſpecially to effect and order it, who are ouer their people, as the head and minde is ouer the bodie to guide and direct them. And therfore as the head and the mind is very prouident for the good of the body, and neglecteth not any inferiour member, but dooth aydeit and ſupport it, ſeeing, hearing, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is good for it. quickning, and heartening the whole body: So is it the

But for the magiſtrates to ſee them, and not to take order for them, as if this buſineſſe belonged not vnto them, it is moſt intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

The beſt of them, while they make a trade and occupation of begging, by little and little, grow verie diſorder lie, ſhaking off the yoke of diſcipline from their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and growe ſenſeleſſe in Religion, and without feeling of God, and godlineſſe. It was not therefore without vrgent cauſe, that God prouided, by a ſpeciall Lawe, that that there ſhould not bee a begger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Which caueat and prouiſo amongſt the graueſt, and wiſeſt of the Gentiles, was holden moſt neceſſarie, by a common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, perceiuing right wel, that this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly begging was not only hurtfull vnto

Among the auncient Romaines, it was enacted, and ordeined, that none ſhoulde goe about begging, and by the lawe of the twelue Tables, this lewde courſe of life was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhibited.

Of this we haue a memorable example in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the time of famin, peſtilence,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 9. cap. 8.</note> and murren, which raged horribly vnder <hi>Maximinus,</hi> at what time great number of Pagan people, through the tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of the Chriſtians, were ſaued from deſtruction, who otherwiſe moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably and rufully muſt haue periſhed: whereby it came to paſſe, that thoſe which before did proſecute the Chriſtians with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hoſtilitie, became their friendes, and intreated their good will, and publikely did auouch, that onely compaſſion was ſhewed by the Chriſtians, and therefore that the Chriſtians profeſſion, was onely the true

Which <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata,<note place="margin">Marke this well.</note> marking, and conſidering, leſt for their munificence they ſhould be honored, and carry the applauſe, and loue of the people: hee commaunded certaine Hoſpitals to be erected, endowing them with land,<note place="margin">Sozom. li. 5. cap. 16.</note> and yearly reuenewes, by which the poore might be ſuccored and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained: inſerting in a letter written to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacius,</hi> an idolatrous prieſt, this reaſon, which was the occaſion of his purpoſe: That it was a foule ſhame, for the worſhippers of theyr gods, not to be ayding to the needful eſtate of their owne people, with their charitable contributions, when as the wicked Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (for ſo this curſed wretch tearmed the Chriſtians) were not only good to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I wold this ſaying could now be made good, to the glory of him, and our credit, whoſe names wee do beare, and whoſe doctrine we ſeem to hold. But it is far otherwiſe: we are but painted tombes, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly glorious, but inwardly we are full of

VVe do therfore diſſemble with our lips, &amp; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with our double tongs, our zealous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are but to deceiue the harts of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to bleare the eyes of the world: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the <hi>Gibeonytes,</hi> in crafty wilineſſe, who made <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and his ſouldiers beleeue,<note place="margin">Ioſua. 9.</note> that they were men, that came from a farre country, and wold make a league &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between them: and to induce them to the better crediting of them, brought olde ſhooes and bottles for wine, olde ſackes, and old bread, that was dried, and mouldie.
